      `I started my development journey at a young age, experimenting with front-end and back-end technologies before I even knew the term "full-stack developer". What began as curiosity has now grown into a passion for building scalable, user-friendly web applications.`,
      `Over time, I learned to overcome early challenges—struggling with CSS led me to discover Bootstrap, which made styling faster and cleaner. That experience taught me the value of using the right tools to solve problems efficiently.`,
      `Today, I specialize in full-stack development using technologies like React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world products that deliver value to users.`,
